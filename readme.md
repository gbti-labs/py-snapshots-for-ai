# [Snapshots.py (for AI)](https://gbti.io/assets/snapshots-for-ai/)

Snapshots.py is a tool that allows you to quickly generate machine/AI-readable documentation that shows your project's current folder and file structure, as well as the updated contents of all the files, all inside a markdown file.

## Installation

Integrate `Snapshots.py` into your project by following these steps:

### Step 1: Download the Package from GitHub

1. Visit the GitHub repository at [gbti-labs/py-snapshots-for-ai](https://github.com/gbti-labs/py-snapshots-for-ai/).
2. Click on the green **Code** button, then select **Download ZIP** from the dropdown menu.
3. Save the ZIP file to your desktop or another preferred location and extract its contents.

### Step 2: Copy Required Files to Your Project

From the extracted folder, copy the following files and folders into the base directory of your project application:

- `snapshot.py`: The main script file for generating snapshots.
- `snapshots/`: The directory intended for storing generated snapshot files.

### Step 3: Install Required Dependencies

Open your command line interface (CLI), navigate to your project's base directory, and install the required dependencies using the following commands:

```sh
pip install chardet==5.1.0
pip install gitignore-parser==0.1.3
pip install pyperclip==1.8.2
pip install pytz==2022.7.1
```

This will ensure all necessary libraries are installed for `Snapshots.py` to operate correctly within your project.

### Step 4: Verify Installation

Ensure that `snapshot.py` is located in your project's base directory and that the `snapshots/` folder is present and correctly placed. You're now ready to utilize `Snapshots.py` within your project.

## Usage

Snapshots can be generated by running the `snapshot.py` script, which can be executed in the terminal of your code editor. 

`python snapshot.py`

The resulting snapshot markdown files will be present inside the `snapshots/captures` folder.

To preview a snapshot, you can navigate to the `snapshots/captures` folder in the GitHub repo and click on one of the markdown files.

## Features

Snapshots.py includes the following features:

* Auto-detect sensitive keys in JSON files and obfuscate them, so your data is better protected from AI.
* Customizable pattern-based ignore system that helps you prevent including unwanted information in your markdown reports.
* Prependable message to explain to the AI the nature of the markdown document and how to interpret it.

These features can be customized in the `snapshot.py` file.
